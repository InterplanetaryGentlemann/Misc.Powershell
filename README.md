# Random SCP Script
This was an excuse for me to play around with Powershell's Random Number Generator. 
The script generates a random number and appends it to the URL for the Secure. Contian. Protect. Foundation website.
The sript opens this page in the OS's defualt browser. This allows for random pages to be brought up for this website. 
Series can be selected before running the script, limiting what numbers are generated.
